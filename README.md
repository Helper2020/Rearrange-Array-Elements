# Rearrange-Array-Elements

I used a modifed merge sort to return two arrays
then use a function to create two  max sums.
I chose The merge sort because O(nlog(n)) and
just before it sorts the entire array it splits
the array into two sorted arrays. Then I pick
numbers from those two sorted arrays.

Where n is the length of the array.
Time complexity: O(nlog(n) + n) -> O(nlog(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
